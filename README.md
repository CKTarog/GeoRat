The programmers used a visual novel program called "Ren'py" which uses python to be able to create this app.
This Launcher is used in order to be able to run the app if it is not yet downloadable as a separate application.
The 7zip file contains all the codes and images used.
Meanwhile separate files for codes "rpy" is also provided to view the souce codes.

To launch GeoRat, once Ren'py is downloaded, select the create new project.
Download and extract the 7zip file.
If you have the 7zip file already, there is no need to download the individual "rpy" code files.
Once extracting the files, replace all files in the file directory of the new created project in Ren'py.
Go back to the launcher and Launch Project.
